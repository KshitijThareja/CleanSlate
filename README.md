## About the app

College hostels are a common accommodation option for students, especially those who are studying away from home. However, managing a college hostel can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to addressing issues that arise. An issues management app can help college hostel managers streamline their operations and ensure that students have a comfortable and safe stay.

Here are some features in our app:

Maintenance requests: Students can report any maintenance issues they encounter during their stay, such as a broken window or a leaking faucet, students can write a description about the issue and even add a picture to get the best assistance from hostel staff. Hostel staff can receive notifications of these requests and schedule repairs accordingly.

Leave requests: The app can be used to notify hostel staff if any student wants to take a leave. Staff can quickly respond to these alerts and take appropriate action other than manually checking which all students took leave.

Overall, a hostel issues management app can help college hostel staff improve the student experience, increase efficiency, and ensure the smooth running of hostel operations. By streamlining communication, simplifying maintenance, and providing real-time alerts, this app can make the job of managing a college hostel much easier.
